in this folder there are three files written in c:

-approx_pi.c: It is simply a code which calculates Pi in a non multi-thread version
-loop.c: It is the code requested by exercise 2
-parallel_pi.c: It is a code which calculates Pi using Openmp and using different commands for the race condition

Also, there are two file .sh to run in order to produce the output:
-loop.sh
-parallel.sh

In order to produce the output, we have the following command
qsub -l nodes=1:ppn=20,walltime=00:50:00  parallel.sh
qsub -l nodes=1:ppn=20,walltime=00:50:00  loop.sh

Output will be saved in a file .txt
