-In the first folder there is the code which built and print the identity matrix
using openmpi approach and blocking communication
In order to compile this code we have the following command (Obviously we have to download openmpi modules):
			
			mpicc  identity.c -std=gnu99 -o pi
			
In order to run this code, we have the following command:

		mpirun -np 4 ./pi
		


- in the second folder, there are two exercise in which we explore the way of communicating
between different procs in openmpi 
Here we have a script bash which produce the two executables and print results
in two different .txt files
